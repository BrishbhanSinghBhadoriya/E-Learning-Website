The ".NET Fullstack" course is designed to provide students with a robust
 understanding of full-stack development using the .NET framework. The course begins
  with an introduction to C#, a modern, object-oriented programming language used extensively
   within the .NET ecosystem. Students learn fundamental programming concepts such as inheritance,
    polymorphism, exception handling, and data structures. Practical coding exercises and projects
     help solidify these skills, ensuring learners have a strong base in C# before moving on to more
      complex topics.

Next, the course delves into front-end development using ASP.NET, a framework 
for building dynamic web pages and applications. Here, students are introduced to
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular front-end libraries and frameworks like Angular
  or React. This segment focuses on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces and
   integrating them seamlessly with server-side components. Learners also explore data
    binding, model-view-controller (MVC) patterns, and client-side scripting. Hands-on
     projects allow students to apply their skills in real-world scenarios, reinforcing
      their learning and preparing them for full-stack development.

The final phase of the .NET Fullstack course covers back-end development using ASP.NET
 Core, a cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected 
 applications. Topics include building RESTful APIs, working with databases using Entity 
 Framework Core, and implementing security features such as authentication and authorization.
  Students also learn about deploying .NET applications to cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.
   By the end of the course, participants will have the knowledge and skills to design, develop,
    and deploy full-stack applications using the .NET framework, making them well-prepared for
     a career as a full-stack developer.
