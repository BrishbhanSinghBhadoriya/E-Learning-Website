<h1 class=""><b>MEAN Stack</b></h1>
<p class="text-justify ">

The "MEAN Stack" course aims to equip learners with the skills to develop
 modern web applications using the MEAN stack, which comprises MongoDB,
  Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.The course begins with an introduction
   to MongoDB, an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. Students 
   learn how to design databases, model data, and perform CRUD operations,
    gaining practical experience through hands-on exercises. Next, learners
     dive into Express.js, a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, where
      they build robust server-side applications and RESTful APIs, handle HTTP 
      requests, and implement middleware functions

The course then shifts focus to Angular, 
a powerful front-end framework developed by Google.
 Students explore the key concepts of Angular, including 
 components, directives, services, and the Angular CLI. Through
  practical projects, they learn how to build dynamic, responsive,
   and scalable single-page applications (SPAs). The course also covers 
   advanced topics like form handling, dependency injection, and the use of RxJS 
   for reactive programming. This section ensures that learners can seamlessly integrate 
   the front-end with the back-end services while maintaining a consistent user experience

Finally, the course integrates Node.js, enabling students to use
 JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. This segment
  covers building scalable network applications, managing asynchronous operations,
   and integrating with various APIs and databases. By the end of the "MEAN Stack" 
   course, participants will have a well-rounded understanding of full-stack development 
   and be prepared to create fully functional web applications. The comprehensive curriculum
    ensures that learners are industry-ready, with the knowledge and practical experience needed
     to pursue careers as full-stack developers.
