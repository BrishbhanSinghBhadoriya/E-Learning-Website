The "Java Fullstack" course is meticulously curated for aspiring full-stack
 developers who aim to excel in both front-end and back-end technologies using Java.
  The course starts with an in-depth exploration of Core Java, where foundational concepts
   such as object-oriented programming, data structures, exception handling, and Java libraries
    are covered comprehensively. Early on, students engage in practical exercises to strengthen their
     programming skills, laying a solid ground for advanced topics. This segment ensures that learners
      are well-equipped with essential Java knowledge before they transition into full-stack development.

<br>
<p class="text-justify"> The second phase of the course introduces learners
 to front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks
  like Angular or React. This module focuses on creating interactive, user-friendly web
   interfaces and integrating them seamlessly with back-end services. Simultaneously,
    participants learn to manage databases using SQL and NoSQL technologies such as MySQL,
     PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Hands-on projects and assignments allow students to apply these 
     skills in real-world scenarios, reinforcing their learning and preparing them for complex 
     challenges in full-stack development.   </p>
<br>
<p class="text-justify">In the final phase, the course delves into back-end development
 with Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), covering critical technologies such as servlets,
  JSP, Spring Framework, Hibernate, RESTful web services, and microservices architecture.
   Students learn to build robust, scalable, and secure server-side applications, integrating 
   them with front-end technologies to create end-to-end solutions. By the end of the "Java Fullstack"
    course, participants will possess a comprehensive skill set, enabling them to design, develop, and
     deploy full-stack applications efficiently. This holistic approach ensures that learners are industry-ready,
      capable of handling the diverse responsibilities of a full-stack developer.  </p>
